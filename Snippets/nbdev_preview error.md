## The fix 

This apparently was a problem in the quarto install. 

I went to this: https://quarto.org/docs/download/ to get the pre-release and installing that package (1.5.40) all the problems went away. 

## Things that didn't work:

Things that I had tried, uninstalling/reinstalling pandoc, lpeg, neovim, etc.
