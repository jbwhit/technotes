Argue that `log(1 + y)` is a bad approach: 

> We argue that ATEs for log-like transformations should not be interpreted as approximating percentage effects, since unlike a percentage, they depend on the units of the outcome. In fact, we show that if the treatment affects the extensive margin, one can obtain a treatment effect of any magnitude simply by rescaling the units of _Y_ before taking the log-like transformation.

ATE -- Average Treatment Effect

They propose three ways of dealing with this problem: 

> We discuss several alternative approaches that may be sensible in settings with an intensive and extensive margin, including (i) expressing the ATE in levels as a percentage (e.g., using Poisson regression), (ii) explicitly calibrating the value placed on the intensive and extensive margins, and (iii) estimating separate effects for the two margins (e.g., using Lee bounds).


1. Poisson regression
2. explicitly calibrate the value on the margins
3. estimating separate effects for each margin (Lee bounds?)
