1. Do we ever need to use 

```python
%matplotlib inline
```

in Jupyter Lab anymore?

2. How do I add [[EDA Pandas Profiling]] to the [[nbdev]] environment?

3. What is the difference between `s.add(s2)` and `s.radd(s2)` for series methods?
	1. It's "right" add, and doesn't make a difference for adding, but rdiv type things it'd matter.
