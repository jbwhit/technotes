There are several levels that I consider for what I know. 

| Level | Description | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0 | I better not forget this or I'm in deep trouble | My name, `import pandas as pd`, etc. |
| 1 | Stuff that I want to know at my fingertips: Anki-able | That I can do: `pd.... (axis='columns')` |
| 2 | Stuff that I want to be *very fast* to lookup. | That I have a snippet for `read_csv`, so when I search for it, I find: ```<br>df = pd.read_csv(<br>    filename,<br>    dtype_backend='pyarrow', <br>    engine='pyarrow',<br>     )<br>```  |
